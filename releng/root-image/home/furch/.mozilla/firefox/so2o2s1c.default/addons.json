Automatically sets browser.tabs.drawInTitlebar to false and gives the option to reset it to default on uninstalling/disabling. (no longer happens as of 1.2beta.)\n\nI did not realize posting the beta would push it out to everyone. With a fully reviewed extension, that does not happen. 1.2beta broke the close button. It should be fixed in beta2. That should show up automatically in a few hours/days or you can get it by clicking on \"Version Information\" and the Version 1.2beta link at the bottom of the add-ons page here. Now beta3 - fixes a css selector error in beta2 that threw an error but should have worked correctly anyway.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/96/96074.png?src=api&modified=1365313458","width":"700","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/96/96074.png?src=api&modified=1365313458","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"150"}],"averageRating":5,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-tab-bar-with-one-tab/?src=api","homepageURL":"http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=2141579","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/249890/hide_tab_bar_with_one_tab-1.3-fx.xpi?src=api","size":13332,"developerComments":null,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-tab-bar-with-one-tab/reviews/?src=api","reviewCount":98,"totalDownloads":72581,"weeklyDownloads":1355,"dailyUsers":21380,"updateDate":1395241028000,"supportURL":"http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=48&t=2141579"},{"id":"firefox-hotfix@mozilla.org","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/354/354399-32.png?modified=1369154804","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/addon_icons/354/354399-64.png?modified=1369154804"},"name":"Mozilla Firefox hotfix","type":"extension","version":"20140319.01","repositoryStatus":4,"creator":{"name":"Mozilla","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/mozilla/?src=api"},"description":"This official add-on enables Firefox to provide quick fixes for selected issues.","fullDescription":"This official add-on enables Firefox to provide quick fixes for selected issues.
